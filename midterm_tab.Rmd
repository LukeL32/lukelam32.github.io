## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. It should have a table of content (TOC form) or in a tab form. The Rmd files of Tab and Toc form are available on the class webpage. 

**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use Rmd samples of the class slides that are available on the class webpage. 
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can follow these below instructions. 
    
    - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figure-size.html
    
    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient.

-------

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.
```{r}
library(haven)
```

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 
```{r, eval=False}
df <- read_sas('hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
```

3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)
```{r, eval=False}
library(dplyr)
df <- df %>% filter(yod=='18')
```
    
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r, eval=False}
df <- df %>% select("yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm",
                      "ancilar","campus","er_fee","er_chrg",
                      "er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day")
```
 

*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  
```{r, eval=False}
library(tidyverse)
write_csv(df,'midterm.csv')
```

5. What are variables that have missing values?
```{r}
df <-read_csv("midterm.csv")
library(tidyverse)
colSums(is.na(df))
```
 
6. Remove all variables with missing values. 
```{r}
df %>% select(-payfix,-preopday,-obs_hour,-nicu_day)
```
 
7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?

Ans: MOA and MOD

8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?
```{r}
table(df$moa)
```
Month 10 has the most admitted patients.

```{r}
dfq8 <- df %>%
  filter(sex == '1')
table(dfq8$moa)
```
Month 10 also has the most male admitted patients.

9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?
```{r}
dfq9 <- df %>%
  filter(sex == '2', age %in% (13:19))
table(dfq9$moa)
```
Month 3 has the most number of teenage female patients.

10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October?
```{r}
dfq10 <- df %>%
  filter(sex == '2', moa == '10')
table(dfq10$provider)
```
Provider 7205 has the most number of female patients in October.

11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average?
```{r}
dfq11 <- df %>%
  group_by(sex == '1') %>%
  summarise(mean(age))
dfq11
```
No, male patients are older than female patients, on average.

12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?
```{r}
dfq12 <- df %>%
  group_by(moa) %>%
  summarise(mean(age))
dfq12
```
Month 1 has the oldest patients on average.

13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?
```{r}
dfq13 <- df %>%
  group_by(provider) %>%
  summarise(sum(tot))
dfq13
```
Provider 7205, Rhode Island Hospital, has the highest total charge.

14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?
```{r}
dfq14 <- df %>%
  filter(sex == '1', age %in% (13:19)) %>%
  group_by(provider) %>%
  summarise(sum(tot))
dfq14
```
Provider 7214, Women and Infants, has the least total charge for teenage males on average.

15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?
```{r}
library(dplyr)
df$season <- case_when(df$moa %in% c('1','2','3') ~ 'Winter', df$moa %in% c('4','5','6') ~ 'Spring', df$moa %in% c('7','8','9') ~ 'Summer', df$moa %in% c('10','11','12') ~ 'Fall')

dfq15 <- df %>%
  group_by(season) %>%
  summarise(mean(los))
dfq15
```
The Fall season has the longest length of stay on average.

16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?
```{r}
dfq16 <- df %>%
  filter(age == '20', sex == '1', season == 'Fall') %>%
  summarise(sumTot = sum(tot), sumLos = sum(los))
dfq16$chargePerDay = dfq16$sumTot/dfq16$sumLos
dfq16$chargePerDay

```
On average, a 20-year-old male gets charged $6,058.25 for staying 1 day in the fall season.

17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 

This section was important for getting a clean data set and basic visualizations to learn more about our data. For cleaning the data set, a subset was taken for just the patients in the year 2018. This gives us a simpler data set to work with. It it also worth noting that a few variables with missing values were removed from the data set at the start as a part of the cleaning. In terms of the results from this section, one of the most notable findings was about provider 7205, Rhode Island hospital. This provider had significantly more patients than any other provider, and the same held true when the data was subset, as well. It is also important to note that when any analysis was preformed that was comparing data from different months, all months had very similar data. With all of the analysis performed, there was not really one month that stood out above the rest.

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis
```{r}
#plot 1
df %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=provider, fill=sex), position = 'dodge') +
  labs(x='Provider', 
       y='Count of Patients',

       title='Average Total Cost Based on Sex',
       caption='Pink represents males, green represents females, blue represents other. This scatter plot displays the average total cost for each sex.')
```

```{r}
#plot 8
df %>%
  filter(pay_ub92 < 20) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  #x into y

       fill = 'Age Range', 
       title = 'Patients for Each Payment, Sorted by Age range', 
       caption = 'Chart shows what payment methods are common for different age ranges.')
```

2. Make an animation plot. 
```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(lubridate)

d1 <- df %>% group_by(ageRange, pay_method) %>% summarise(avg_tot = mean(tot))
d2 <- d1 %>% group_by(ageRange) %>% mutate(rank=rank(-avg_tot)) 
d3 <- d2 %>% filter(rank <= 10)
a1 <- d3 %>% ggplot(aes(x=rank, y=avg_tot, group=pay_method, fill=pay_method, label=pay_method)) + geom_col()+
    geom_text(aes(y = avg_tot, label = pay_method), hjust = 1.4)+ 
    coord_flip(clip = "off", expand = FALSE) +scale_x_reverse()+
    labs(title = 'Age Range {closest_state}', x='', y='Total Charge', fill='Payment Method')+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 22),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y  = element_blank()) + 
    transition_states(ageRange)+
    ease_aes("cubic-in-out")
animate(a1, nframes = 200)
```

3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

I was able to create many significant plots for visualization of trends and better understanding the data. In particular, plot 6 was able to give a lot of information, giving us a noticeable sine-like  pattern and a difference between male and female patients. Otherwise, I was able to find lots of information about different payment types, breaking them up by sex, age, and age range. Options like medicare were popular for older patients, and workers compensation was more popular for make patients. I am happy with the results that i was able to get because many of the plots show something interesting and significant about the data.

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 

```{r}
df$target <- case_when(df$tot < median(df$tot) ~ 'low',TRUE ~ 'high')
```

*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
```{r}
df3 <- df %>% select("age", "sex", "raceethn", "provider", "moa", "mod", "admtype", "campus", "los", "target")
```
  
  
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)

df3 <- df3 %>% 
  filter(raceethn!='',admtype!='') %>% 
  mutate(target=as.factor(target),
    sex=as.factor(sex),
    raceethn=as.factor(raceethn),
    provider=as.factor(provider),
    admtype=as.factor(admtype),
    campus=as.factor(campus))

set.seed(2020)
parts <- createDataPartition(df3$target, p = .1, list = FALSE)

traindf <- df3[ parts,]
testdf <- df3[-parts,]
```

2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 
```{r}
library(rpart)
treedf <- rpart(target ~ ., data = traindf, control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(treedf)
```

```{r}
barplot(treedf$variable.importance)
```

3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(mlbench)
```

```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",number = 5)
tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),min.node.size = c(1:10))
model2 <- train(target ~ ., data=traindf,method = "treebag",trControl = trControl, maxdepth = 5)
prediction2 <- predict(model2, testdf)
confMatrix2 <- confusionMatrix(data = prediction2, reference = testdf$target)
confMatrix2$overall[1]
```

```{r}
model1 <- train(target ~ ., data= traindf ,method = "rpart2", trControl=trControl, maxdepth = 5)

prediction1 <- predict(model1, testdf)
confMatrix1 <- confusionMatrix(data = prediction1, reference = testdf$target)
confMatrix1$overall[1]
```

4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3.
```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Model 1' = model1,'Model 2' = model2))
bwplot(results)
```

5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data.

Final selection is model 1.

```{r}
predictionFinal <- predict(model1, testdf)
confMatrixFinal <- confusionMatrix(data = predictionFinal, reference = testdf$target, positive = "low")
confMatrixFinal$overall[1]
```
6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5.
```{r}
df3_2 <- df3
df3_2$target <- case_when(df3$provider == '7205' ~ 'RI Hospital', TRUE ~ 'Other')
df3_2 <- df3_2 %>% select(-provider, -campus)
```

```{r}
df3_2 <- df3_2 %>% 
  filter(raceethn!='',admtype!='') %>% 
  mutate(target=as.factor(target),
    raceethn=as.factor(raceethn),
    admtype=as.factor(admtype))

set.seed(2020)
parts2 <- createDataPartition(df3_2$target, p = .1, list = FALSE)

traindf2 <- df3_2[ parts2,]
testdf2 <- df3_2[-parts2,]
```

```{r}
library(rpart)
treedf2 <- rpart(target ~ ., data = traindf2, control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(treedf2)
```
```{r}
barplot(treedf2$variable.importance)
```

```{r}
model3 <- train(target ~ ., data= traindf2 ,method = "rpart2",trControl = trControl, maxdepth = 5)

prediction3 <- predict(model3, testdf2)
confMatrix3 <- confusionMatrix(data = prediction3, reference = testdf2$target)
confMatrix3$overall[1]
```

```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",number = 5)
tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,splitrule = c('gini', 'extratrees'),min.node.size = c(1:10))
model4 <- train(target ~ ., data=traindf2,method = "treebag",trControl = trControl, maxdepth = 5)
prediction4 <- predict(model4, testdf2)
confMatrix4 <- confusionMatrix(data = prediction4, reference = testdf2$target)
confMatrix4$overall[1]
```

```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Model 1' = model3,'Model 2' = model4))
bwplot(results)
```

```{r}
predictionFinal <- predict(model4, testdf2)
confMatrixFinal <- confusionMatrix(data = predictionFinal, reference = testdf2$target, positive = "RI Hospital")
confMatrixFinal$overall[1]
```


7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

In this section, the models and decision trees turned out to have a decent level of accuracy. It is important to use multiple types of models in this case because there are some things that are covered by some models but not others, so creating multiple models allows us to get the most optimal one. In terms of the actual results, the accuracies for the first set of models turned out to be above 0.8, which was higher than those for the the binary models. For the binary models, it was necessary to remove some variables from the data set in order to prevent overfitting and confounding variables. After this was done, similar analyses were performed, and accuracies below 0.8 were produced. I was still able to select one model over the other, but this was not before running the training multiple times to get an accuarate model.
